# AgiLion

AgiLion is a ticket support system, where you can sign in, ask questions, write notes, view all your tickets and of course- get help from the support staff!<br />
It's a hands-on MERN project I developed while self-learning the course [React Front To Back 2022](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-front-to-back-2022/) by Brad Traversy on Udemy.<br /><br />

* Database:

  * Mongoose- ODM

* Node.js & Express.js:
